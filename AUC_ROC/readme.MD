Finds AUC and ROC for two classifiers that each model 2 class data as 2 gaussian distributions with diff means and variances

Better classifier is the one that gives higher AUC

sample_size can be changed (default: 1000 samples will be generated for each distribution)

ROC and AUC are displayed and printed


Competitor's technology has better AUC.
ROC curves, PDF curves are shown


AUC values for particular random sampling method used:
AUC for Third Eye technologies is  0.8776295000000001
AUC for competitor is  0.9121085
