## Artificial neural network

Does forward pass and backpropagation, for a single ANN with 5 hidden units and 3 output units.
You can change number of epochs, inputs, outputs, number of hidden and output nodes etc.
Training Input - 8 1-D vectors and 8 corresponding targets.

Input is 1 hot encoding of numbers from 0 to 8. Output is the binary representation of numbers from 0 to 8. You can modify it to whatever you like.

The ANN is able to learn the mapping with a learning rate of ~0.8.
